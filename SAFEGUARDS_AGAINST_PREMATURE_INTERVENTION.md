# Safeguards Against Premature Intervention

## The Critical Problem You Identified

**Scenario: Agent Abandoning CORRECT Strategy Too Early**

```
Step 20:  Agent calls start_over with "two-phase topological sort" (CORRECT!)
Steps 21-25: Agent implementing complex solution...
          - Step 21: Creates InputCell class
          - Step 22: Creates ComputeCell class  
          - Step 23: Implements propagation logic
          - Step 24: Adds callback tracking
          - Step 25: Still coding...
          
Step 25:  Tests run: 0p_1f (no improvement yet - still implementing!)
          Dynamic system sees "stuck" → Tier 1 intervention! ❌
          Forces strategy change → Abandons CORRECT approach!
```

**The agent needs TIME to implement complex solutions!** Tests don't improve until implementation is complete.

## Protection Mechanisms Added

### 1. **Grace Period After start_over**

```python
GRACE_PERIOD_AFTER_RESET = 15  # 15 steps after start_over
```

**How it works:**
```python
if next_tool_name == 'start_over':
    progress_tracker['last_start_over_step'] = step
    logger.info("Grace period begins - 15 steps protected")

# Later, when checking for stuck:
steps_since_reset = step - progress_tracker['last_start_over_step']
in_grace_period = steps_since_reset < 15

if in_grace_period:
    # SKIP intervention - agent is still implementing after reset
    logger.info(f"In grace period ({steps_since_reset}/15) - skipping intervention")
```

**Example:**
```
Step 30:  start_over called
Steps 31-44: Grace period - NO INTERVENTIONS
Step 45:  Grace period ends - now can check for stuck again
```

### 2. **Active Implementation Detection**

```python
# Track code edits
if next_tool_name == 'apply_code_edit':
    progress_tracker['code_edit_count'] += 1

# Check if actively coding
actively_implementing = code_edit_count >= 3
```

**How it works:**
```python
# Every 5 steps, check if agent made 3+ code edits
if actively_implementing:
    # SKIP intervention - agent is actively coding!
    logger.info(f"Agent actively implementing ({code_edit_count} edits) - skipping intervention")
    code_edit_count = 0  # Reset for next interval
```

**Example:**
```
Steps 20-24: Agent makes 4 apply_code_edit calls
Step 25:     Progress check: 0p_1f (no test improvement)
             BUT: 4 recent edits detected!
             → Skip intervention (agent is actively working)
```

### 3. **Minimum Steps Before Intervention**

```python
MIN_STEPS_BEFORE_INTERVENTION = 10
```

**Prevents:**
- Intervention at step 5 (too early!)
- Gives every strategy at least 10 steps minimum

### 4. **Combined Safeguard Logic**

```python
# ALL conditions must be true to trigger intervention:
if (step >= MIN_STEPS_BEFORE_INTERVENTION and      # At least 10 steps
    intervention_tier == 0 and                      # No prior interventions
    stuck_counter >= CONSECUTIVE_STUCK_TOLERANCE and  # Actually stuck
    not in_grace_period and                         # NOT in grace period ✅
    not actively_implementing):                     # NOT actively coding ✅
    # OK to intervene
```

## Example Timeline with Safeguards

### Scenario 1: Agent Implementing Correct Solution

**Without Safeguards (OLD):**
```
Step 20:  start_over with "two-phase sort"
Step 25:  3 code edits, 0p_1f → Tier 1! ❌ (abandons correct approach)
```

**With Safeguards (NEW):**
```
Step 20:  start_over with "two-phase sort"
          Grace period starts (15 steps)
Steps 21-25: 4 code edits
Step 25:  Progress check: 0p_1f
          ✅ In grace period (5/15 steps) → Skip intervention
Step 30:  Progress check: 0p_1f  
          ✅ In grace period (10/15 steps) → Skip intervention
Step 35:  Progress check: 0p_1f
          ✅ In grace period (15/15 steps) → Skip intervention
Step 36:  Tests run → All tests pass! ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Agent Truly Stuck (Not Implementing)

**With Safeguards:**
```
Step 20:  start_over
Steps 21-35: Grace period
Step 36:  Grace period ends
Steps 36-40: Agent only calls get_file_content repeatedly
             No code edits (0 edits)
Step 40:  Progress check: 0p_1f
          ✅ Not in grace period (20 steps since reset)
          ✅ Not actively implementing (0 recent edits)
          ✅ Stuck counter = 4
          → Tier 1 intervention triggered! ✅ (correct - agent is stuck!)
```

### Scenario 3: Agent Making Many Edits (Active Work)

**With Safeguards:**
```
Step 15:  Agent makes 5 code edits in last 5 steps
Step 15:  Progress check: 0p_1f (no test improvement yet)
          ✅ 5 recent edits detected (actively implementing)
          → Skip intervention (agent is working!)
Step 20:  Agent makes 2 more edits
Step 20:  Progress check: 0p_1f
          ✅ 2 recent edits (still actively working)
          → Skip intervention
Step 25:  Agent makes 0 edits (stopped coding, just reading)
Step 25:  Progress check: 0p_1f
          ❌ 0 recent edits (NOT actively working)
          ❌ Not in grace period
          ✅ Stuck counter = 5
          → Tier 1 intervention! ✅ (correct - agent stopped making progress)
```

## Key Metrics Tracked

```python
progress_tracker = {
    'last_start_over_step': 0,     # When did agent last reset?
    'code_edit_count': 0,           # How many edits since last check?
    'recent_tools': [],             # Last 10 tools called
    'stuck_counter': 0,             # How many checks with no progress?
    'last_progress_step': 0,        # When did we last see test improvement?
}
```

## Tuning the Safeguards

You can adjust based on your needs:

### More Protective (Longer Implementation Time)
```python
GRACE_PERIOD_AFTER_RESET = 20      # 20 steps after reset
actively_implementing = code_edit_count >= 2  # Consider 2+ edits as active
```

### Less Protective (Faster Intervention)
```python
GRACE_PERIOD_AFTER_RESET = 10      # Only 10 steps grace
actively_implementing = code_edit_count >= 5  # Need 5+ edits to be "active"
```

## What Gets Protected

✅ **Agent just called start_over** → 15 step grace period
✅ **Agent making multiple code edits** → Skip intervention
✅ **Complex implementation in progress** → Detected by edit count
✅ **Tests improving** → Stuck counter resets anyway

## What Doesn't Get Protected (Correct!)

❌ **Agent reading files repeatedly with no edits** → Intervention triggers
❌ **Agent stuck in analysis loop** → Intervention triggers
❌ **Grace period expired and no progress** → Intervention triggers
❌ **Agent stopped editing and tests still failing** → Intervention triggers

## Summary

The system now distinguishes between:

1. **Agent actively implementing** (making edits) → Protected ✅
2. **Agent just reset codebase** (start_over) → Protected ✅
3. **Agent truly stuck** (no edits, no progress) → Intervene ✅

This prevents abandoning correct strategies while still catching genuine stuck states! 🎯

## Expected Log Output

**When Protected:**
```
[FIX_WORKFLOW] In grace period after start_over (12/15 steps) - skipping intervention
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Agent actively implementing (4 recent edits) - skipping intervention
```

**When Intervening:**
```
[FIX_WORKFLOW] ⚠️  No progress: 3 consecutive checks, 15 steps since last progress
[FIX_WORKFLOW] 🟡 TIER 1 INTERVENTION at step 25
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Agent stuck for 15 steps - forcing strategy re-plan
```

The safeguards are smart enough to let the agent work while catching genuine stuck states! 🚀
