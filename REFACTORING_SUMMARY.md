# Test-Driven Agent Refactoring Summary

## Problem Identified

The original `test_driven_agent.py` had a **logical flaw** with significant code duplication:

1. Both `create_mode` and `fix_mode` had ~150 lines of duplicate iteration logic
2. Both independently handled:
   - Test running and result parsing
   - Stuck detection (same failures for multiple iterations)
   - Alternative architecture generation and testing
   - Solution comparison and selection
3. The duplication made maintenance difficult and bug-prone

## Correct Logic

The only difference between CREATE and FIX modes should be:

- **CREATE mode**: Generate initial solution → Post workflow
- **FIX mode**: (Solution already exists) → Post workflow
- **Post workflow** (unified for both):
  - Run tests iteratively
  - Call `fix_test_failures` on failures
  - If stuck over multiple runs → try alternative architecture
  - Repeat until success or timeout

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified `post_workflow` Function (Lines 442-659)

```python
def post_workflow(problem_statement: str, solution_files: Dict[str, str], 
                  timeout: int, start_time: float, mode: str = "CREATE") -> str:
    """
    Unified post workflow for both CREATE and FIX modes.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Run tests iteratively
    2. Fix failures with fix_test_failures
    3. If stuck → try alternative architecture
    4. Repeat until success or timeout
    """
```

**Features:**
- Handles test execution and result parsing
- Detects stuck situations (same failures for 2+ iterations)
- Tries up to 10 alternative architectures when stuck
- Gives each alternative 3-4 iterations to improve
- Compares and selects best solution
- Tracks tried architectures to avoid duplicates

### 2. Simplified `create_mode` (Lines 661-710)

**Before:** ~190 lines with full iteration logic
**After:** ~50 lines

```python
def create_mode(problem_statement: str, timeout: int) -> str:
    # Step 1: Generate initial solution
    solution_files = generate_solution(problem_statement)
    
    # Step 2: Generate tests
    test_files = generate_test_files(...)
    
    # Step 3: Run unified post workflow
    return post_workflow(problem_statement, solution_files, timeout, start_time, mode="CREATE")
```

### 3. Simplified `fix_mode` (Lines 1383-1419)

**Before:** ~170 lines with full iteration logic
**After:** ~37 lines

```python
def fix_mode(problem_statement: str, timeout: int) -> str:
    # Step 1: Find relevant existing code
    relevant_files = find_relevant_files(problem_statement)
    
    # Step 2: Generate reproduction test if needed
    test_file = generate_reproduction_test(problem_statement, relevant_files)
    
    # Step 3: Run unified post workflow
    return post_workflow(problem_statement, relevant_files, timeout, start_time, mode="FIX")
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated ~300 lines of duplicate code**
2. **Single source of truth** for test-driven refinement logic
3. **Easier maintenance** - fixes/improvements only need to be made once
4. **Clearer separation of concerns**:
   - CREATE: Initial solution generation
   - FIX: Finding existing code
   - POST_WORKFLOW: Test-driven refinement (shared)
5. **Consistent behavior** between CREATE and FIX modes
6. **Better code organization** and readability

## Validation

- ✅ Code compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ Both modes now use identical post-processing logic
- ✅ Alternative architecture support works for both modes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
