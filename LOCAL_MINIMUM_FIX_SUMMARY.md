# Local Minimum Trap - Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The test-driven agent was stuck in an infinite loop, repeatedly achieving 18/22 tests and failing the same 4 tests across all architectural approaches. The system would restart with "fresh context" but immediately fall into the same local minimum.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Premature Termination**
   - `stuck_threshold=2` - Refinement stopped after only 2 iterations with identical failures
   - `stuck_rounds >= 2` - Early restart triggered after just 2 rounds
   - LLM didn't get enough attempts to learn from its mistakes

2. **False Architecture Diversity**
   - All 6 "different" architectures (FSM, Microservices, Event-driven, etc.) passed **exactly 18/22 tests**
   - Same 4 tests failed: `test_encode_with_spaces_and_punctuation`, `test_decode_with_spaces`, `test_edge_case_a_equals_25`, `test_mixed_alphanumeric_and_punctuation`
   - Problem wasn't architectural—it was specific edge case logic bugs

3. **Insufficient Fix Context**
   - `fix_failures()` prompt didn't show iteration history
   - LLM couldn't learn from previous failed attempts
   - No explicit edge case analysis methodology
   - Missing "why did the previous fix fail?" reasoning

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Increased Iteration Limits (Lines 132, 1515, 2298)

```python
# BEFORE
stuck_threshold: int = 2  # Too low
if stuck_rounds >= 2:     # Restarts too early

# AFTER  
stuck_threshold: int = 4  # Doubled - allows more refinement attempts
if stuck_rounds >= 4:     # 4 rounds before restart
```

**Impact:** Gives LLM 2x more iterations to fix edge cases before giving up.

### 2. Added Iteration History Tracking (Lines 1105, 1107-1140)

```python
class FixManager:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.iteration_history: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []  # NEW
    
    def apply_fix(self, ..., iteration_num: int = 0):
        # Record each attempt with test output
        self.iteration_history.append({
            'iteration': iteration_num,
            'test_output': test_output[-2000:],
            'success': True/False
        })
```

**Impact:** Tracks what was tried and whether it worked, enabling learning.

### 3. Enhanced Fix Prompt with Debugging Methodology (Lines 796-898)

**Added:**
- **Previous Attempts Section** - Shows last 3 attempts and which tests still fail
- **Explicit Warning** - "If SAME tests failing repeatedly, your approach is WRONG"
- **Step-by-Step Debugging Methodology:**
  1. Analyze the exact error (expected vs actual)
  2. Trace the root cause (not just symptoms)
  3. Test your mental model (manual trace-through)
  4. Handle edge cases (boundary conditions)

**Before:**
```python
prompt = f"""You are an expert debugger. Fix the failing tests.
Instructions:
1. Read error messages
2. Fix the code
...
```

**After:**
```python
prompt = f"""You are an expert debugger (Iteration #{iteration_num + 1}).

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS (Learn from these):
Iteration 0: ✓ Generated fix
  Still failing: test_encode_with_spaces_and_punctuation, test_decode_with_spaces
Iteration 1: ✓ Generated fix  
  Still failing: test_encode_with_spaces_and_punctuation, test_decode_with_spaces

⚠️ IMPORTANT: SAME tests failing repeatedly - your approach is WRONG!

DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY:
Step 1 - ANALYZE THE EXACT ERROR:
- What is EXPECTED vs ACTUAL output?
...
```

**Impact:** 
- LLM sees its previous mistakes
- Forced to use systematic debugging approach
- Explicitly warned when stuck in loop

### 4. Reset History Between Refinement Rounds (Line 1359)

```python
def run(self, ...):
    # Reset iteration history for this refinement round
    self.fix_manager.iteration_history = []
```

**Impact:** Fresh start for each architecture attempt, prevents context pollution.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Stuck in Loop)
```
Round 1: 18/22 tests → Stuck after 2 iterations → Try new architecture
Round 2: 18/22 tests → Stuck after 2 iterations → Try new architecture  
Restart Attempt 2...
Round 1: 18/22 tests → Stuck after 2 iterations → INFINITE LOOP
```

### After (Should Progress or Fail Gracefully)
```
Round 1: 18/22 tests → 4 refinement attempts → 20/22 tests
Round 2: 20/22 tests → 4 refinement attempts → 21/22 tests
Round 3: 21/22 tests → 4 refinement attempts → 22/22 SOLVED
```

OR if truly stuck:
```
Round 1: 18/22 tests → 4 attempts, no progress → Try architecture 2
Round 2: 18/22 tests → 4 attempts, no progress → Try architecture 3
Round 3: 18/22 tests → 4 attempts, no progress → Try architecture 4
Round 4: 18/22 tests → 4 attempts, no progress → Restart with fresh context
Attempt 2...
[After max_attempts, report failure gracefully]
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor Logs for:**
   - "PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS (Learn from these)" - confirms history is working
   - "Iteration #2", "Iteration #3" - confirms more iterations running
   - Actual score progression (18→19→20→21→22)

2. **Success Criteria:**
   - Agent progresses beyond 18/22 tests
   - OR fails gracefully after exhausting all attempts (no infinite loop)

3. **Red Flags:**
   - Still stuck at 18/22 after 4 iterations → Prompt may need further tuning
   - Infinite loop persists → Check if changes were properly loaded

## Additional Notes

The core insight: **The agent wasn't exploring enough variations within each architecture**. It gave up too quickly (2 iterations) before trying different debugging approaches. By doubling the iteration count and adding explicit debugging methodology with iteration history, the LLM now has:

1. More chances to fix edge cases (4 vs 2 attempts)
2. Context about what already failed (iteration history)
3. Structured approach to debugging (methodology steps)
4. Explicit warning when repeating mistakes

This should break the local minimum trap by ensuring each architecture gets a fair chance with systematic debugging before moving to the next approach.
