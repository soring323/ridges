# CRITICAL BUG: Workflow Exits Immediately After Init

## Evidence from Logs

```
2025-10-29 12:29:01,705 - INFO - [FIX_WORKFLOW] ENTERED fix_task_solve_workflow
2025-10-29 12:29:01,705 - INFO - [FIX_WORKFLOW] timeout=2000s, n_max_steps=400
2025-10-29 12:29:01,705 - INFO - [FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì PEVWorkflow initialized
HEAD is now at 91f2e47 Initial commit  ‚Üê PROCESS EXITS HERE!
[AGENT_RUNNER] Exited agent's agent_main()
```

## The Mystery

**Expected:**
1. Enter workflow ‚úÖ
2. Initialize PEVWorkflow ‚úÖ
3. Run strategy planning ‚ùå
4. Initialize guidance ‚ùå
5. Enter main loop (Step 1, 2, 3...) ‚ùå
6. Generate patch ‚ùå
7. Exit normally ‚ùå

**Actual:**
1. Enter workflow ‚úÖ
2. Initialize PEVWorkflow ‚úÖ
3. **IMMEDIATELY EXITS** - no further logs ‚ùå

## Critical Missing Logs

These logs were added but NEVER appeared:
- `[FIX_WORKFLOW] Problem type determined: bug_fix`
- `[FIX_WORKFLOW] Starting strategy planning phase...`
- `[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì Strategy selected: X`
- `[FIX_WORKFLOW] === Step 1/400 ===`
- `[CREATE_TASK] fix_task_solve_workflow completed`

**This means the process crashed/exited between lines 4433 and 4442 of sam_fix.py**

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Theory 1: Silent Exception (**Most Likely**)
Something raises an exception after PEVWorkflow init, but it's being caught by an outer try-catch that doesn't log it.

**Evidence:**
- Logs stop abruptly
- Git reset happens (cleanup from test harness)
- Process exits cleanly (no crash dump)

### Theory 2: Process Timeout
The agent process might have a timeout that kills it.

**Evidence Against:**
- timeout=2000s (plenty of time)
- Only ~2 seconds elapsed at init point
- No timeout warning in logs

### Theory 3: sys.exit() Call
Hidden sys.exit() or os._exit() somewhere.

**Evidence Against:**
- Would need to be between line 4433 and 4442
- No such code visible in that section

### Theory 4: Signal Handler
External process killing the Python agent.

**Evidence:**
- Git reset happens immediately
- Could be test harness detecting a problem

## What We Added to Catch It

### 1. Exception Handling Around PEVWorkflow Init
```python
try:
    pev = PEVWorkflow(...)
    logger.info("[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì PEVWorkflow initialized")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] FATAL: PEVWorkflow initialization failed: {e}")
    logger.error(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    raise
```

### 2. Exception Handling Around Strategy Planning
```python
logger.info("[FIX_WORKFLOW] Starting strategy planning phase...")
try:
    strategy = pev.run_planning_phase(...)
    logger.info(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì Strategy selected: {strategy.get('name', 'Unknown')}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] FATAL: Strategy planning failed: {e}")
    logger.error(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    raise
```

### 3. Exception Handling Around Entire Workflow Call
```python
patch = None
try:
    patch = fix_task_solve_workflow(...)
    logger.info("[CREATE_TASK] fix_task_solve_workflow completed SUCCESSFULLY")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"[CREATE_TASK] FATAL: fix_task_solve_workflow CRASHED!")
    logger.error(f"[CREATE_TASK] Exception: {e}")
    logger.error(f"[CREATE_TASK] Traceback:\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
    raise
```

### 4. Progress Logging
```python
logger.info(f"[FIX_WORKFLOW] Problem type determined: {problem_type}")
logger.info("[FIX_WORKFLOW] Starting strategy planning phase...")
```

## Next Run - What to Look For

### Scenario A: Exception Caught
```
[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì PEVWorkflow initialized
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Problem type determined: bug_fix
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Starting strategy planning phase...
[FIX_WORKFLOW] FATAL: Strategy planning failed: KeyError('strategies')
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Traceback: ...
[CREATE_TASK] FATAL: fix_task_solve_workflow CRASHED!
```

**Action:** Fix the specific exception

### Scenario B: External Timeout/Kill
```
[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì PEVWorkflow initialized
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Problem type determined: bug_fix
[FIX_WORKFLOW] Starting strategy planning phase...
(no more logs - process killed externally)
HEAD is now at...
```

**Action:** Investigate test harness timeout settings

### Scenario C: Still Exits at Same Point
```
[FIX_WORKFLOW] ‚úì PEVWorkflow initialized
HEAD is now at...
(no additional logs)
```

**Action:** 
- Exception is being raised INSIDE PEVWorkflow.__init__() but after our try-catch
- Need to add logging inside PEVWorkflow itself
- Check if there's a __del__() destructor causing issues

## Suspicious Code Locations

### PEVWorkflow.__init__()
```python
def __init__(self, enable_pev: bool = True, enable_test_guidance: bool = True, ...):
    self.enable_pev = enable_pev
    # ... more init ...
    if enable_pev:
        self.planner = StrategicPlanner()  ‚Üê Could crash here
        self.verifier = Verifier()          ‚Üê Or here
        if enable_test_guidance:
            self.guidance = TestDrivenGuidance()  ‚Üê Or here
```

**If StrategicPlanner(), Verifier(), or TestDrivenGuidance() raise exceptions, they would happen INSIDE PEVWorkflow init.**

### StrategicPlanner.__init__()
```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = DEEPSEEK_MODEL_NAME):
    self.model_name = model_name
    self.outcome_tracker = StrategyOutcomeTracker()  ‚Üê Could crash loading file
    self.selected_strategy = None
```

### StrategyOutcomeTracker.__init__()
```python
def __init__(self, outcomes_file: str = ".strategy_outcomes.json"):
    self.outcomes_file = outcomes_file
    self.outcomes = self._load_outcomes()  ‚Üê Could crash loading JSON
```

### TestDrivenGuidance.__init__()
```python
def __init__(self, trace_learner: TraceBasedLearning = None):
    self.trace_learner = trace_learner or TraceBasedLearning()  ‚Üê Could crash
    self.api_analyzer = APIPatternAnalyzer()
```

### TraceBasedLearning.__init__()
```python
def __init__(self, trace_file: str = ".agent_traces.json"):
    self.trace_file = trace_file
    self.traces = self._load_traces()  ‚Üê Could crash loading JSON
```

## Most Likely Culprit

**StrategyOutcomeTracker or TraceBasedLearning are trying to load corrupted JSON files!**

The files `.strategy_outcomes.json` or `.agent_traces.json` might:
- Not exist (should be handled)
- Be corrupted JSON (should be handled by try-catch, but might not be)
- Have permission issues
- Be locked by another process

## Immediate Fix If JSON Loading is the Problem

Both classes have this pattern:
```python
try:
    with open(self.trace_file, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError, IOError):
    return []
```

But what if there's a **different exception**? Like:
- PermissionError
- OSError (disk full)
- UnicodeDecodeError
- IsADirectoryError

**Solution:** Change to catch all exceptions:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to load {self.trace_file}: {e}")
    return []
```

## Summary

**The agent workflow is crashing somewhere in the initialization chain:**
```
fix_task_solve_workflow() 
  ‚Üí PEVWorkflow() 
    ‚Üí StrategicPlanner() 
      ‚Üí StrategyOutcomeTracker() 
        ‚Üí _load_outcomes()  ‚Üê CRASH HERE?
```

**With the new logging, the next run will show us EXACTLY where and why!**

Run again and check for:
1. ‚úÖ Exception messages with tracebacks
2. ‚úÖ Which initialization step fails
3. ‚úÖ Specific error that's killing the process

The mystery will be solved! üîç
